## Html Geolocation
##-hi im a lil stoned this morning, i am hoping to develop the add to cart webpage of 
the tuatuagye ecomernce site before monday. That means i have to finish it before saturday so that 
i will have enough room to put the backend code in a class, this will make it easier for me to build
upon the work from time to time.

i tot about writing journals for my codes everyday, to enable me fully immerse myself into the work, cuz
for one reason i will be having conversations with me, i am a genius so how cool is it to chat with
a genius, second i will also be teaching myself programming which is what will assimilate the knowledge of
coding, i don't know which work i will be doing tomorrow yet i am moral obligated to do my very best where i am.


-what  i really want to do is to use the jquery to get how far an element is from the viewport 
i will call this geo-location (get_geolocation), use a means to read the media screen width into a
variable (var media_screen), fetch the position of the element in the layout into a variable(var layout)
and calculate the new geolocation for the element and apply it in the webpage immediately the window resizes.
of coarse i can do this with css media queries but using js will help me fully manipulate the dom in dev mode


## revelation
after about six hours of playing around with the idea i learnt about jquery noConflict() function,
perfected my jquery ui and also discovered the problem with my element position property is css will
simply be solved when i use position relative, that way even if the media screen size changes the
element remains relative to the viewport. this has saved me hours of stress in the future. Also
in case where i can't use position relative, i can use pos absolute on the outter div instead
